                                        different clients will connect to. Each client is given its own pthread and
                                        the database is accessed and modified via fine-grained locking. The server
                                        implements basic signal handling and will cleanly open and close client

                                        coalescing blocks on the free list and by only allocating additional memory when
                                        required.

                                    <p class="tab-2">Shell was a project that used C to create a basic shell. This shell
                                        had several builtin functions (including cd, rm, and exit) and would run all
                                        other commands via execv within a child process. It also handled basic file
                                        redirection. Additionally, it allowed for execution of foreground and background
                                        processes, which were tracked by a job list that could be accessed by the user.
                                        Basic signal handling was also implemented.

                                        options between them. It supported finding the quickest, cheapest, and fastest
